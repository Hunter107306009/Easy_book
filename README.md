# Eazy Book
Provide a platform for consumers to register as members for restaurant reservations. Establish a membership system on the platform based on the frequency of visits or the amount of consumption. Additionally, create a record of transactions and accumulate member points. Restaurants can also register on this platform and automatically allocate table numbers based on the number of guests for reservations. The platform also includes a blacklist management feature.
